int ix = 1024, *pi = &ix, *pi2 = new int(2048);
typedef unique_ptr<int> IntP;
a) IntP p0(ix);
Illegal, can't take in an int
b) IntP p1(pi);
Legal but will result in undefined behavior/throw error at runtime.
c) IntP p2(pi2);
Legal but when p2 goes out of scope, pi2 will be dangling. 
d) IntP p3(&ix);
Legal but same problem as b. 
e) IntP p4(new int(2048));
Legal and recommended.
f) IntP p5(p2.get());
Illegal, can't use get().
