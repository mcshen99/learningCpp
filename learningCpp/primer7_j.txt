1. When should you use the default keyword?
There are no arguments. We want other constructors and the synthesized version. Each of the data members
have a default constructor/destructor as well. 

2. What is the only difference between struct and class? For what type of objects should you use each?
When we want all members to be public, we use struct, specifically for basic data. 
When we want all private, we use class, specifically for objects. 

3. When might you use a friend declaration? (hint: think about the software development process).
When you use a class (the data is private), so that you can access data members when the function/class is not
a part of original class. 
Use in testing process, so you can test internal methods. 

4. What is the difference between assignment and initialization?
Initialization is just when you declare the variable but assignment is when you give the variable its value. 

5. Why do you need an initializer list? Why not try to initialize inside the constructor body?
If you initialize inside the constructor body, that will assign them the value. Const and references need to be 
initalized. 

6. What is the difference between vector<int> v(2) and vector<int> v{2}?
vector<int> v(2) initializes a vector of size 2 and automatically sets the values to 0. 
vector<int> v{2} initializes a vector of size 1 with an int of value 2.
