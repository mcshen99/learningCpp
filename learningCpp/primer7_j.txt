1. When should you use the default keyword?
There are no arguments. We want other constructors and the synthesized version and each of the data members
have built-in type. 

2. What is the only difference between struct and class? For what type of objects should you use each?
When we want all of members to be public, we use struct. When we want all private, we use class.

3. When might you use a friend declaration? (hint: think about the software development process).
When you use a class (the data is private), so that you can access data members when the function/class is not
a part of original class. 

4. What is the difference between assignment and initialization?


5. Why do you need an initializer list? Why not try to initialize inside the constructor body?


6. What is the difference between vector<int> v(2) and vector<int> v{2}?
