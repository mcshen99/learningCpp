auto p = new int();
auto sp = make_shared<int>();
a) process(sp);
Legal. In process sp has 2 reference counts and it uses sp. Once it is finished, sp is decremented. 
b) process(new int());
Illegal. This is a regular pointer and cannot be converted to a shared pointer.
c) process(p);
Illegal. Same problem as b.
d) process(shared_ptr<int>(p));
Legal. p is converted a shared pointer and then it does the same thing as a.
